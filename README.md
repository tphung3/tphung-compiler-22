Details: https://dthain.github.io/compilers-fa22



The compiler is broken down to 5 steps: scan -> parse -> print (optional) -> resolve -> typecheck -> codegen. Type `make` to build the compiler `bminor`. You can find relevant instructions on how to run each of these steps in the respective test scripts.
